## What is Analytics Zoo?
__Analytics Zoo__ provides a unified analytics + AI platform that seamlessly unites *__Spark, TensorFlow, Keras and BigDL__* programs into an integrated pipeline; the entire pipeline can then transparently scale out to a large Hadoop/Spark cluster for distributed training or inference. 

In addition, Analytics Zoo also provides a rich set of analytics and AI support for the end-to-end pipeline, including:
- *Easy-to-use abstractions and APIs*: such as Spark Dataframe and ML pipeline support, auto-differentiation operations, transfer learning support, online model serving API, etc. 
-	*Common feature engineering operations* for image, text, 3D image, etc.
- *Built-in deep learning models*: such as image classification, object detection, text classification, recommendation, etc. 
- *Reference use cases*: such as anomaly detection, sentiment analysis, fraud detection, image augmentation, object detection, variational autoencoder, etc.
