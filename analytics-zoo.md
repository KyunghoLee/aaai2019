## What is Analytics Zoo?

__Analytics Zoo__ provides a unified analytics + AI platform that seamlessly unites __Spark, TensorFlow, Keras and BigDL__ programs into an integrated pipeline; the entire pipeline can then transparently scale out to a large Hadoop/Spark cluster for distributed training or inference. 

To make it easy to build and productionize deep learning applications for Big Data, Analytics Zoo also provides a rich set of analytics and AI support for the end-to-end pipeline (e.g., easy-to-use abstractions and APIs, common feature engineering operations, built-in deep learning models, reference use cases, etc.).
