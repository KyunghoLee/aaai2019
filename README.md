## Description
Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence applications have brought deep learning to the forefront of new generations of data analytics. In this tutorial, we will present the practice and design tradeoffs for building large-scale deep learning applications (such as computer vision and NLP) for production data and workflow on Big Data platforms. In particular, we will provide an overview of emerging deep learning frameworks for Big Data (e.g., BigDL, TensorFlow-on-Spark, Deep Learning Pipelines for Spark, etc.), present the underlying distributed systems and algorithms, and discuss innovative data analytics + AI application pipelines (with a focus on computer vision models and use cases) for Big Data platforms and workflows.
